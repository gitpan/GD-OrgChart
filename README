GD/OrgChart version 0.01
========================

This module will draw those organization charts so popular in the
corporate world.  It was developed with the intention of automatically
generating the charts from the LDAP datastore, rather than manually
the other way around.

This is a pure perl module, no compiling necessary.  However, it is
dependent upon the GD package.
