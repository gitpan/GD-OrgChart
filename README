GD/OrgChart version 0.03
========================

This module will draw those organization charts so popular in the
corporate world.  It was developed with the intention of automatically
generating the charts from the LDAP data-store, rather than manually
the other way around.

This is a pure Perl module, no compiling necessary.  However, it is
dependent upon the GD package.

WARNINGS

The name-space for this module is not yet "approved".  It is our
intention, based upon the recommendation of one of the "module committee"
members, to modify this module, with Matt Sanford's help, to make it able
to also perform the functionality of the Image::OrgChart module.

As such, there may be some changes in the interfaces of this module
as we do this.
